## Podcast

From April 2017 to June 2018 Rene along with friend and colleague, Spencer Bockover, worked to produce a live weekly interview format radio show on USF Bulls Radio. Each week they presented anthropology as an opportunity for professional research and practice. You can now listen to AnthroAlert as a podcast.
